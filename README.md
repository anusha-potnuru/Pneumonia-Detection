# Pneumonia-Detection
This work is done as group project for the course Deep Learning(CS60010) in IIT Kharagpur curriculum. <br>
We explore the task of automatically detecting pneumonia from chest X-rays using deep neural networks. <br>

## Dataset
Chest X-Ray images described and analyzed in ”Deep learning-based classification and referral of treatable human diseases” for the training and evaluation of our models. 

## Experiments
We experimented with various models such as VGG, ResNet and DenseNet under multiple settings and achieved best results for DenseNet. <br>

**DensetNet performance:** <br>
Accuracy: 84% <br>
Precision: .80 <br>
Recall: .99 <br>
F1-Score: .89 <br>
